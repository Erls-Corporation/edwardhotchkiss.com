Make is a really old piece of *NIX systems that automates a build processes. The build process doesn't need to be a .c project, it works great with any type of software application.

Using a Makefile within a project directory let's you drastically reduce the time spent doing trivial tasks. **If you have a ./scripts/ directory handling your tasks then you're doing it wrong**.

**Install UglifyJS & LESS:**

{% highlight bash %}

$ [sudo] npm install uglify-js -g
$ [sudo] npm install less -g

{% endhighlight %}

**Create your Makefile:**

{% highlight bash %}

$ cd my_project
$ touch Makefile

{% endhighlight %}

**Setup your Makefile:**

{% highlight bash %}

# CSS Directory
CSS_DIR = assets/css/

# LESS Directory
LESS_DIR = assets/less/

# JS Directory
JS_DIR = assets/js/

# minify CSS with LESSC
css:
  lessc ${LESS_DIR}index.less ${CSS_DIR}main.min.css -compress

# minify JavaScript with UgilifyJS
js:
  uglifyjs -o ${JS_DIR}main.min.js ${JS_DIR}jekyll.js

# start jekyll
run:
  jekyll --server

.PHONY: js css

{% endhighlight %}

**Usage:**

{% highlight bash %}

$ make css
$ make js

{% endhighlight %}

**In Closing:**

In current and past projects I have all kinds of Makefile setups. Some commands are pretty sweet such as "make deploy". **Automate. Everything**.
