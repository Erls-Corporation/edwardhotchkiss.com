When I was a much younger developer; I often wondered why older developers were not embracing blogging. I felt that it was this excitig new technology that would change how we communicated. I wrote, and often felt that the seemingly wiser, older tech stars had much more to say than myself. So I stopped writing.

Flash-forward to **Age 30**, and I think of a quote by the lovel Ms. Plath:

> "The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence."
> -- Sylvia Plath, "The Bell Jar"

More and more often I meet younger developers that have questions, with a yearn for truly satisfying knowledge. I may now speak.
