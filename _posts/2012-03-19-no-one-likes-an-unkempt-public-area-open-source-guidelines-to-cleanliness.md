Open Source has one general pre-requisite: that it be freely redestributed and community driven. When [GitHub](http://github.com/) was introduced; the ecosystem saw a logical and pragmatic way to bring together disparate developers to easily fork a repository, make changes and submit a pull request. Suddenly everyone and everything was embracing open-source; from corporations sponsoring projects to use as their lifeblood, to individuals creating basic concepts for self-use and using GitHub as a free storage ground.

There was no moderation, no one set any guidelines, or best practices on how to do ***Open Source*** on GitHub. The natives had no way except by casual reference or language/framework requirements to determine how to setup a proper and organized repository structure.

As a repository owner: you have certain obligations (some of which I am guilty of not keeping up). Especially those repositories that are highly active with community usage and with codebase contributions from outside developers. You have an obligation to release code that is tested. Automated spec is preferrable. You have an obligation to document your code and build process, most especially -- your contribution and pull request policy.

**Why am I obligated?**. These developers are sweating blood and tears to give you, of all people ***free code***. You setup this sweet idea, and people fix your code for free -- pretty wild right? Tell any outside party and they will have their mind blown.

I recently wanted to contribute to a larger project and couldn't find my way around. I'm an experienced programmer and have contributed to projects before. The repository looked like something out of hoarders - best of. There were .project files littered all over the place, total lack of automated test process, and private discourse on project futures.

Then there are the people doing it right. Checkout [Knockout.js](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/). There are three organized folders with all examples and documentation on a separate branch/[Website](http://knockoutjs.com/) and a clean structure like a boss. 

**Two sweet articles to rock out with:**

[How To Write A Readme](http://jesusabdullah.github.com/2011/11/09/readmes.html) & of course [How to be...
an open-source gangster](http://jsconf.nodejitsu.com/).

Help the guy wanting to add sweet feature x to your project. **Ten minutes** of your time making it easier for the dude busting his ass spending **ten hours** of his time is well worth it.
