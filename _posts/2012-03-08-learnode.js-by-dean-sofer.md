I haven't seen dedication like this since [Mr Hands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumclaw_horse_sex_case)!

A colleague of mine spent a lot of time bringing together a screencast using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) & MongoDB from beginning to fully deployed app in an hour and 12 minutes. 

I often get a lot of questions on where to start, what to start with, & what tools to use. Dean did a really nice job of bringing all of that together.

**From his Page:**

  "An End-to-End introduction to Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, Mongoose and AngularJS using Nodester and MongoHQ. Go from absolutely 0 knowledge to having a basic, functional, deployed CRUD application live and online in just one hour!"
