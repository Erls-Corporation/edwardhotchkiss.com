I started (like most JavaScript "people") with client-side JavaScript. A recently contract has thrown me upon the lovely [Angular.js](http://angular.js). Through much mucking and testing -- I see it as the cleanest, DRYest possibility for a web framework.

When I started using it, the current version was **v0.9.19**. The guys at Google writing Angular had broad plans, so began a series of 0.10.x iterations that would become the release candidate that I'm using today. The API breaking changes were enormous, so I'll just focus on the current i mplementation.
