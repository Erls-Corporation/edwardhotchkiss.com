**Background:**

I think that route setup in [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org) is unsexy. No one likes to feel unsexy (**to all my bitches out there can I get a yayyaahhh**) -- so let's write a "class" to duplicate the smoothe operator style of [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com).

Another thing that I like about Express that Angular doesn't do -- is automatically matching trailing slashes (/route matches /route and /route/).

**The Angular.js Way:**

**Implemened in Angular:**
