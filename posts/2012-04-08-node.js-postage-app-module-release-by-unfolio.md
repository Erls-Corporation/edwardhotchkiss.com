**What's PostageApp?**

[PostageApp](http://postageapp.com/) is a really sweet high octane service that let's you auth in to send email from web apps.

**Why?**

After checking out **PostageApp**'s current Node.JS API Module I noticed that it lacked some needed error handling and was using some deprecated http calls.

At **Unfolio** we released a nicely packaged new PostageApp module.

**Sending an Email:**

In addition there methods for fetching project info, account info, message receipts etc.
