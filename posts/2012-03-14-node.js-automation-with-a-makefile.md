Make is a really old piece of *NIX systems that automates a build processes. The build process doesn't need to be a .c project, it works great with any type of software application.

Using a Makefile within a project directory let's you drastically reduce the time spent doing trivial tasks. **If you have a ./scripts/ directory handling your tasks then you're doing it wrong**.

**Install UglifyJS & LESS:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2785534.js?file=install.sh"></script>

**Create your Makefile:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2785534.js?file=create.sh"></script>

**Setup your Makefile:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2785534.js?file=make.sh"></script>

**Usage:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2785534.js?file=usage.sh"></script>

**In Closing:**

In current and past projects I have all kinds of Makefile setups. Some commands are pretty sweet such as "make deploy". **Automate. Everything**.
