The debate rages on over whether or not the Apple iPad is a "Flash Killer". One point which most people neglect to mention is that Adobe AIR powers TweetDeck, an application **CREATED** in Adobe Flash, which allows for cross-platform compatibility.

With Android right on Apple's tail, and an imminent launch of Flash 10.1 for the Android platform; will Apple finally cave? There is a long standing symbiotic relationship between both Apple Computers and Adobe. Can the rift be repaired, or will I be stuck for the next ten years reading endless debates on the futility or vitality of either platform.

Ironically, most of these opponents of Flash are tweetings against Flash ***via*** TweetDeck for Desktop (Made with Adobe AIR. ie: **FLASH**).

Hypocrites or pure ignorance?
