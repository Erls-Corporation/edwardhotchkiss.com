    <h4><a href="/blog/2012/03/07/On-Blogging">On Blogging</a></h4>
    <p>When I was a much younger developer; I often wondered why older developers were not embracing blogging. I felt that it was this excitig new technology that would change how we communicated. I wrote, and often felt that the seemingly wiser, older tech stars had much more to say than myself. So I stopped writing.</p>

<p>Flash-forward to <strong>Age 30</strong>, and I think of a quote by the lovel Ms. Plath:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The silence depressed me. It wasn&rsquo;t the silence of silence. It was my own silence.&rdquo;
&mdash; Sylvia Plath, &ldquo;The Bell Jar&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>More and more often I meet younger developers that have questions, with a yearn for truly satisfying knowledge. I may now speak.</p>
